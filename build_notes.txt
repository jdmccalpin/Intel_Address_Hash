The updated version ("Map_Addresses_to_L3_Slices_ICX.c") can be built in a single step.  (va2pa_lib.c is #included and ssum.c is not called before exit)

With the Intel icc compiler, I used
	icc -sox -g -O0 -DMAP_L3 -DMYHUGEPAGE_THP -DCHA_COUNTS  Map_Addresses_to_L3_Slices_ICX.c -o Map_Addresses_to_L3_Slices_ICX.exe

The resulting code ran correctly on a 40-core ICX (Xeon Platinum 8380).

To Do:
	1. Reduce NUMPAGES from 40960 (80 GiB) to something more reasonable -- 1024 is probably fine to start.
	2. There is tons of code from other tests in here -- not needed but does not seem to break anything.
		Should be cleaned out at some point.
	3. Eventually I need to merge the SKX, ICX, and SPR versions of this code into a single source file.
		The CHA counter addressing is different and the SPR has different EventSelect values for the CHA 
		events, but the changes can be isolated to few sections.

Already Done:
	1. Remove all the code below the MAP_L3 section -- it is not used in the Address to L3-Slice mapping.
		Not tested in execution, but compiles OK.
