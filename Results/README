File format information for Intel_Address_Hash/Results/ files

Each file named "BaseSequence_<proc>_<nn>-slice.tbl" contains the "base sequence" of
L3/CHA numbers (as reported by the hardware performance counter in the processor
"uncore") for one of the processor configurations tested.  The "base sequence"
in each case is the set of L3/CHA numbers for cache line addresses starting at
physical address zero in the processor's memory space.

	"<proc>" values are
		"KNL"	Xeon Phi x200 Processor "Knights Landing"
		"SKX"	Xeon Scalable Processor (1st or 2nd gen) "Skylake Xeon" or "Cascade Lake Xeon"
		"ICX"	Xeon Scalable Processor (3rd gen) "Ice Lake Xeon"
		"SPR"	Xeon Scalable Processor (4th gen) "Sapphire Rapids Xeon"
				or Xeon CPU Max Processor ("Sapphire Rapids with HBM).
	"<nn>" values are the number of L3/CHA "slices" for the processor
		(or the number of CHA slices for the KNL processor, which has no L3)
		The number of L3/CHA slices is always at least as large as the number
		of cores.

Each of the "BaseSequence" files is a text file containing one decimal number per line
and one line for each element of the base sequence.  The length of the base sequence
varies from 16 to 16384 lines for these processors.

  Length FileName
   16384 BaseSequence_ICX_28-slice.tbl
     512 BaseSequence_ICX_40-slice.tbl
    4096 BaseSequence_KNL_38-slice.tbl
   16384 BaseSequence_SKX_14-slice.tbl
      16 BaseSequence_SKX_16-slice.tbl
    4096 BaseSequence_SKX_18-slice.tbl
     256 BaseSequence_SKX_20-slice.tbl
   16384 BaseSequence_SKX_22-slice.tbl
     512 BaseSequence_SKX_24-slice.tbl
   16384 BaseSequence_SKX_26-slice.tbl
    4096 BaseSequence_SKX_28-slice.tbl
   16384 BaseSequence_SPR_56-slice.tbl
   16384 BaseSequence_SPR_60-slice.tbl


Each file named "PermSelectMasks_<proc>_<nn>-slice.txt" contains two lines 
related to the "permutation selector masks".
	The first line contains two decimal numbers, the lowest address bit to which
	the permutation selector masks apply, and the highest address bit to which the 
	permutation selector masks apply.  

	The lowest address bit is the first physical address bit above the top of the base
	sequence and should be 6+log2(BaseSequenceLength).

	The highest address bit indicates the address range over which the mask set
	provides correct answers.  E.g., the value "37" indicates that the masks are valid
	for all physical addresses for which the highest bit set is 37 or lower --
	addresses below 2^38 = 256 GiB.

	The second line contains 14 hexadecimal numbers -- these are the permutation
	selector masks for permutation bit 0 (on the left) to permutation bit 13 (on the
	right).  All of the files contain 14 mask values, even if fewer are used.  A
	permutation selector mask of zero corresponds to the identity permutation, so
	results are identical if permutation selector masks of 0x0 are used or ignored.
